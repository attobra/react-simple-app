		  <p>To climb safely, you will need a few pieces of basic equipment. Most rock climbing gyms will rent this equipment to you. You can also buy your own equipment from an outdoor gear store like <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, or look for used gear on <a href="http://raleigh.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>. I highly recommend using rental gear first, before you buy. That will give you a change to find out what you like. Remember, you can don't have to buy everything at once.</p>

		  <h3>Harness</h3>

		  <p>A harness is an absolute requirement for top rope climbing. (You don't use a harness when bouldering.) The harness fits across your waist and legs, attaching you to the rope. Most places have rental harnesses, but they are generally "universal" harnesses designed to fit nearly anyone. They work, but they tend to be very uncomfortable. If you decide you enjoy climbing, it is worth buying your own harness quickly.</p>
		  <p>Because a harness is life-saving safety gear <strong>be very careful</strong> if you buy used gear. A used harness may have been damaged in a fall in a way you cannot see. Don't trust your life to a Craigslist seller. Be sure to inspect any used gear very carefully.</p>
		  <p>Harnesses in the United States generally come sized from extra-small to extra-large. However, these sizes often do not correspond to your pants or dress size, especially if you have a narrow waist. I suggest buying your first harness at a retail store, where an experienced salesperson can help you fit your harness. Expect to spend between $50 and $80 for a basic harness.</p>
